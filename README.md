## 📜 Description

**Virny** is a Python library for auditing model stability and fairness. The Virny library was
developed based on three fundamental principles: 

1) easy extensibility of model analysis capabilities;
2) compatibility to user-defined/custom datasets and model types;
3) simple composition of parity metrics based on context of use.

Virny decouples model auditing into several stages, including: **subgroup metrics computation**, **group metrics composition**,
and **metrics visualization and reporting**. This gives data scientists and practitioners more control and flexibility 
to use the library for model development and monitoring post-deployment.

For quickstart, look at our [Use Case Examples](https://dataresponsibly.github.io/Virny/examples/Multiple_Runs_Interface_Use_Case/).

## 📖 Library Terminology

This section briefly explains the main terminology used in our library.

* A **sensitive attribute** is an attribute that partitions the population into groups with unequal benefits received.
* A **protected group** (or simply _group_) is created by partitioning the population by one or many sensitive attributes.
* A **privileged value** of a sensitive attribute is a value that gives more benefit to a protected group, which includes it, than to protected groups, which do not include it.
* A **subgroup** is created by splitting a protected group by privileges and disprivileged values.
* A **group metric** is a metric that shows the relation between privileged and disprivileged subgroups created based on one or many sensitive attributes.
