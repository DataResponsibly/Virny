# Virny Software Library

## Description

**Virny** is a Python library for auditing model stability and fairness. The Virny library was
developed based on three fundamental principles: 

1) easy extensibility of model analysis capabilities;
2) compatibility to user-defined/custom datasets and model types;
3) simple composition of parity metrics based on context of use.

Virny decouples model auditing into several stages, including: **subgroup metrics computation**, **group metrics composition**,
and **metrics visualization and reporting**. This gives data scientists and practitioners more control and flexibility 
to use the library for model development and monitoring post-deployment.
