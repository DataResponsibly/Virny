# Welcome to Virny

## üìú Description

**Virny** is a Python library for in-depth profiling of model performance across overall and disparity dimensions.
In addition to its metric computation capabilities, the library provides an interactive tool called _VirnyView_
to streamline responsible model selection and generate nutritional labels for ML models.

The Virny library was developed based on three fundamental principles:

1) easy extensibility of model analysis capabilities;

2) compatibility to user-defined/custom datasets and model types;

3) simple composition of disparity metrics based on the context of use.

Virny decouples model auditing into several stages, including: **subgroup metric computation**, **disparity metric composition**,
and **metric visualization**. This gives data scientists more control and flexibility to use the library
for model development and monitoring post-deployment.

For quickstart, look at [use case examples](https://dataresponsibly.github.io/Virny/examples/Multiple_Models_Interface_Use_Case/), [an interactive demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/denys-herasymuk/virny-demo), and [a demonstrative Jupyter notebook](https://huggingface.co/spaces/denys-herasymuk/virny-demo/blob/main/notebooks/ACS_Income_Demo.ipynb).


## üõ† Installation

Virny supports **Python 3.8 and 3.9** and can be installed with `pip`:

```bash
pip install virny
```

## üòé Why Virny

In contrast to existing fairness software libraries and model card generating frameworks, our system stands out in four key aspects:

1. Virny facilitates the measurement of **all normatively important performance dimensions** (including _fairness_, _stability_, and _uncertainty_) for a set of initialized models, both overall and broken down by user-defined subgroups of interest.

2. Virny enables data scientists to analyze performance using **multiple sensitive attributes** (including _non-binary_) and their _intersections_.

3. Virny offers **diverse APIs for metric computation**, designed to analyze multiple models in a single execution, assessing stability and uncertainty on correct and incorrect predictions broken down by protected groups, and testing models on multiple test sets, including in-domain and out-of-domain.

4. Virny implements streamlined flow design tailored for **responsible model selection**, reducing the complexity associated with numerous model types, performance dimensions, and data-centric and model-centric interventions.


## üí° Full List of Features

* Entire pipeline for profiling model accuracy, stability, uncertainty, and fairness
* Ability to analyze non-binary sensitive attributes and their intersections
* Convenient metric computation interfaces: an interface for multiple models, an interface for multiple test sets, and an interface for saving results into a user-defined database

## üìñ Library Overview

![Virny_Architecture](https://github.com/DataResponsibly/Virny/assets/42843889/91620e0f-11ff-4093-8fb6-c88c90bff711)

The software framework decouples the process of model profiling into several stages, including **subgroup metric computation**,
**disparity metric composition**, and **metric visualization**. This separation empowers data scientists with greater control and
flexibility in employing the library, both during model development and for post-deployment monitoring. The above figure demonstrates
how the library constructs a pipeline for model analysis. Inputs to a user interface are shown in green, pipeline stages are shown in blue,
and the output of each stage is shown in purple.
