## 🚀 New Python Versions Support

* Now Virny supports Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12! 🎉🥳


## ⚙️ Fitted Bootstrap Exporting

* Added the `return_fitted_bootstrap` flag to metric computation interfaces to return a fitted bootstrap, which users can save to a pickle file later and reuse for future experiments

* Added the new `compute_metrics_with_fitted_bootstrap` interface in the inference API, where users can provide a fitted bootstrap, use it to do inference, and avoid the heavy bootstrap re-training to get metrics
