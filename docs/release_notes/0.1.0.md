# 0.1.0 - 2023-02-03

- [PyPI] (TODO: link on a pypi package)
- [GitHub] (TODO: ReleaseTag)


## Models Audit Pipeline 🚀

* Developed an **entire pipeline for auditing model stability and fairness** with detailed reports and visualizations

* Designed and implemented an **extensible architecture** split on components (User interfaces, MetricsComposer, etc.) that can be easily adapted to your needs

* Enabled easy pipeline **adaptability for different classification datasets**

* Added a feature to **audit blind classifiers**, which were trained on features without sensitive attributes, and use these sensitive attributes for analysis


## User Interfaces 👩‍💻

* Added three types of user interfaces:

* Interface for multiple runs and multiple models

* Interface for multiple models and one run

* Interface for one model and one run

* Added an ability to input arguments to interfaces via user-friendly config yaml files or direct arguments


## Datasets and Preprocessing 🖼️

* Added built-in preprocessing techniques for raw classification datasets

* Developed an ability to work with non-binary features

* Enabled access to COMPAS and Folktables benchmark datasets via implemented data loaders


## Analyzers and Metrics 💠

* Added an ability to analyze intersections of sensitive attributes

* Implemented a set of statistical bias and variance metrics:

  * **6 subgroup variance metrics**
    * Mean
    * Std
    * IQR
    * Entropy
    * Jitter
    * Label Stability
  * **9 subgroup statistical bias metrics**
    * TPR
    * TNR
    * PPV
    * FNR
    * FPR
    * Accuracy
    * F1
    * Selection-Rate
    * Positive-Rate
  * **5 group variance metrics**
    * Label Stability Ratio
    * IQR Parity
    * Std Parity
    * Std Ratio
    * Jitter Parity
  * **5 group statistical bias metrics**
    * Equalized Odds TPR
    * Equalized Odds FPR
    * Disparate Impact
    * Statistical Parity Difference
    * Accuracy Parity


## Reports and Visualizations 📈

* Added an ability to create predefined plots for result metrics

* Developed a feature to make detailed summary reports with visualizations


## Convenience 😌

* Enabled smart saving of result metrics in files

* In the multiple runs interface, a file with result metrics is saved each time when each run is completed. In such a way, if you get an error in one of the runs, the results of the previous runs will be saved.

* Enabled library installation via pip

* Created and hosted a website for detailed documentation with examples
