## New Metrics Computation Mode ‚öôÔ∏è

* An `error_analysis` mode that measures subgroup and group metrics for correct and incorrect predictions, in addition to default groups. 
For example, when a default computation mode measures metrics for sex_priv and sex_dis, an `error_analysis` mode measures metrics 
for (sex_priv, sex_priv_correct, sex_priv_incorrect) and (sex_dis, sex_dis_correct, sex_dis_incorrect). 
Therefore, a user can analyze how a model is stable or certain about its incorrect predictions.

* An example yaml file for the computation mode:
```yaml
dataset_name: COMPAS
bootstrap_fraction: 0.8
n_estimators: 50
computation_mode: error_analysis
sensitive_attributes_dct: {'sex': 1, 'race': 'African-American', 'sex&race': None}
```


## New Fairness Datasets üóÉ

* **LawSchoolDataset**. A dataset class for the Law School dataset that contains sensitive attributes among feature columns. 
  * Target: predict whether a candidate would pass the bar exam or predict a student‚Äôs first-year average grade (FYA).
  * Source: https://github.com/tailequy/fairness_dataset/blob/main/experiments/data/law_school_clean.csv.
  * Broader description: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.00530.pdf.
* **DiabetesDataset**. A dataset class for the Diabetes dataset that contains sensitive attributes among feature columns.
  * Target: predict whether a patient will readmit within 30 days.
  * Source: https://github.com/tailequy/fairness_dataset/blob/main/experiments/data/diabetes-clean.csv.
  * Broader description: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.00530.pdf.
* **RicciDataset**. A dataset class for the Ricci dataset that contains sensitive attributes among feature columns.
  * Target: predict whether an individual obtains a promotion based on the exam results.
  * Source: https://github.com/tailequy/fairness_dataset/blob/main/experiments/data/ricci_race.csv.

## Analyzers and Metrics üí†

* New subgroup metrics:
  * **Statistical Bias** is a feature of a statistical technique or of its results whereby the expected value of the results differs from the true underlying quantitative parameter being estimated ([ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_(statistics))).
  * **Aleatoric Uncertainty** is a mean entropy of ensemble ([ref](https://www.gdsd.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/2021/gdsd_huellermeier.pdf)).
  * **Overall Uncertainty** is an entropy of mean prediction of ensemble ([ref](https://www.gdsd.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/2021/gdsd_huellermeier.pdf)).

* Changed a reference group in a sensitive_attributes_dct: now **a disadvantaged group is used as a reference** to compute intersectional metrics.
For example, if we need to compute metrics for sex & race group (sex -- [male, female], race -- [white, black]), then sex&race_dis would include records for black females, and sex&race_priv would include all other records in a dataset.
