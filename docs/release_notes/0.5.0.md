## üìñ Glossary

* Our documentation was extended with a new "Glossary" section that provides:
    * Explanation of our approach for measuring model stability and uncertainty
    * Detailed description of the overall and disparity metrics computed by Virny


## ‚öôÔ∏è More Features for Experimental Studies

* Metric computation interfaces were extended with a new optional parameter - `with_predict_proba`. 
If set to `False`, Virny computes metrics only based on prediction labels, NOT prediction probabilities. Specifically, it can be useful in the case when a model cannot provide probabilities for its predictions.
Default: `True`.

* Metric computation interfaces were enabled to measure the computation runtime in minutes for each model. 
It can be particularly useful for a large experimental studies with thousands of pipelines to estimate their runtimes and to benchmark models between each other.


## üóÉ New Benchmark Fair-ML Datasets

* **DiabetesDataset2019**. A data loader for the Diabetes 2019 dataset that contains sensitive attributes among feature columns.
    * Target: Binary classify whether a person has a diabetes disease or not.
    * Source and broad description: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tigganeha4/diabetes-dataset-2019/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tigganeha4/diabetes-dataset-2019/data).

* **GermanCreditDataset**. A data loader for the German Credit dataset that contains sensitive attributes among feature columns.
    * Target: Binary classify people described by a set of attributes as good or bad credit risks.
    * Source: [https://github.com/tailequy/fairness_dataset/blob/main/experiments/data/german_data_credit.csv](https://github.com/tailequy/fairness_dataset/blob/main/experiments/data/german_data_credit.csv).
