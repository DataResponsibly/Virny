## üìàÔ∏è Static and Interactive Visualizations

* An **interactive web app** serves as a visualization component within the Virny model profiling library, empowering data scientists
  _to engage in responsible model selection_ and _to generate nutritional labels for their models_. This application allows users 
  to scrutinize dataset properties related to protected groups, compare models across diverse performance dimensions,
  and generate a comprehensive nutritional label for the most optimal model. The demonstration of the web app is hosted on [the Hugging Face space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/denys-herasymuk/virny-demo).
  More details are in the Examples section of the documentation.

* Improved and extended **static visualizations** provided by the Metric Visualizer.


## ‚öôÔ∏è New Metric Computation Capabilities

* A new capability to input an inprocessor into a metric computation interface as a basic model to **profile an in-processing fairness intervention**.
  Currently, only [inprocessors from aif360](https://aif360.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modules/algorithms.html#module-aif360.algorithms.inprocessing) are supported.
  More details are in the Examples section of the documentation.

* A new capability to input a postprocessor into a metric computation interface to **use post-processing fairness interventions** during model profiling. 
Currently, only [postprocessors from aif360](https://aif360.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modules/algorithms.html#module-aif360.algorithms.postprocessing) are supported.
More details are in the Examples section of the documentation.


## üí† Analyzers and Metrics

* Added a **sample size** for each protected group to an overall metrics matrix. Useful to know if the size of a protected group is big enough to be representative.

* **Simplified adding new metrics**. Now, all functions, which compute overall metrics, are defined in Virny's _metrics_ package.

* **Improved definition of disparity metrics**. Now, all disparity metrics and their expressions are defined in the [Metric Composer](https://github.com/DataResponsibly/Virny/blob/main/virny/custom_classes/metrics_composer.py).


## üóÉ New Benchmark Fair-ML Datasets

* **CreditCardDefaultDataset**. A data loader for the Taiwan Credit Card Default dataset that contains sensitive attributes among feature columns. 
    * Target: predict whether a customer will face the default situation in the next month or not.

    * Broader description: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.00530.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.00530.pdf) (Section 3.1.6).

* **StudentPerformancePortugueseDataset**. A data loader for the Student Performance dataset for the Portuguese subject that contains sensitive attributes among feature columns.
  * Target: the initial regression task was to predict the final year grade of the students. To get a binary classification task, we used a preprocessed dataset from [this repo](https://github.com/tailequy/fairness_dataset). The target label is derived from the attribute _G3_ (representing the final grade), where _target_ = {Low, High}, corresponding to _G3_ = {<10, ‚â•10}.
